The reaction to this observation was the ruination of her career, and the beginning of his status as a pariah among most newsmen.  This book is used to add more ammo to the controversy.That the journalists who so eagerly pry into other peoples lives and business should be reluctant to be examined is hardly surprising.  Almost no one really wants to have his life or business dissected by Mike Wallace not even Dan Rather.  Some facts in this book are really potent such as the survey results which show how the average journalist and the average American are often vastly at odds.  Other chapters highlight different stories that TV news has covered and the analysis that Goldberg has made to point out the liberal bias.  His main theme is that while there is no conspiracy of the left, the fact is that most reporters are liberal but fewer still will admit it.There is some sound reasoning behind this book.  Sadly in execution, it doesn't come off as well as it could.  Goldberg has one argument in all the years he worked closely with Dan Rather (according to him) and yet it seems like all they did was fight.  Why ?  because Goldberg replays that one argument about 5 or 6 times in the book.  Much of the material that is thought provoking the first time around is pretty stale after the third or fourth reading. He kindly reprints the editorial that started the whole furor, too bad this was at the end of the book because the entire first chapter is just a rehash of that argument.  Too often Goldberg is reduced sounding like the bitter vindictive perso 93184\n"

       " 'you may not agree with everything singer says but you will respect him for his ability to use pure logic and facts to back up his beliefs someone made the comment that singer says in his book that it is not okay to kill pigs but perfectly fine to kill the senile and mentally challenged this is not what singer is saying whoever said that clearly didn t read the book merely skimmed its contents or is just not very intelligent he makes the very compelling point that we cannot justify the torture not killing torture there is a difference of another species simply because we view them as less intelligent if we are to use intelligence as our logical guideline on our right to torture living creatures then it would be perfectly logical to torture someone who is mentally handicapped or senile since they do not have the mental capacity of the average human of course singer does not advocate killing people that would just be asinine he makes an analogy which is something that eluded some reviewers who obviously didn t pass th grade english and don t know how to read an analogy at any rate this is only one of many points that singer brings up in this compelling and thought provoking book no one said you have to agree singer he doesn t insist in any way that you convert to vegetarianism he is merely pointing out that the logic that we base our thought processes on are not the only point of view and are not entirely based in reality he points out that there are different ways of looking at things than the normal institutionalized view of our world if you are a student of philosophy you will enjoy thinking about this book and appreciate it for its ability to provoke new and interesting philosophical debates if you are an animal advocate you will enjoy this book for its eloquent and compelling points if you are just a person seeking knowledge you will enjoy learning about other points of view the book is somewhat disturbing as is any book that shows the darker side of human nature but it is worth the read overall it is a very strong case for granting rights to animals of all species including the human species i recommend this book if you are a perpetual student and seeker of knowledge even if you don t agree with singer and his philosophies it is a good read',\n",

       " 'this book was one of the two best stories i have ever read the characters and some of the scenes are magically beautiful but also darkly sinister i can t help think that tolkien the author was trying to catch the reality of this life that there is an almighty struggle between the forces of good and evil there are agents of darkness as well as agents of light i believe that in writing this book he must have felt a great anxiety about finishing such an epic this would have been with the knowledge that it had to be written he is not only telling a brilliant story but he is also pointing towards the real situation not only is this world involved but also whole galxies and perhaps universes in an almighty war between the forces of good and evil there are magical devices scientific machines mysterious races and perhaps even rings of magical power in this battle you can loose your soul you can become a deceived minion of evil beware and watch and pray the road is slippery and yet along the way you will have moments of joy and happiness the one ring of power to bind them all closely represents the urge to power i use the word urge because this is more primal and fundamental than will will emerges from an urge pride is that which needs power to be powerful pride is a form of greed therefore it can clearly be said that the urge to power is an extremely deep rooted urge in the human being perhaps found in all idividualities pride is force whereas the prime quality of humility is gentleness the urge to power forces its way whilst humility the antithesis of pride is truly gentle in an uncontrived manner the urge to power can be hard to overcome this urge in itself is strength or power and as such is potentially very corruptive any super man is in danger through the self destructive urge to power just look at the case of adolf hitler though initially the urge can be a force for growth and development eventually it passes a point where its growth in position knowledge or whatever other form of power expression leads to its own self destruction or onwards into a true enlightement if in pursuit of the spiritual path i find it worrying that we have this urge built into our genetic programming what initially could be of great benefit to the species survival could ultimately either be the end of all life on this planet or its salvation hence the parallel between the one ring to bind them all and human pride the urge for power it should be mentioned that greed plays an important part in the urge for power but we must not forget that it is also part of the species survival mechanism i feel that rather than stronger and stronger weapons which only make us proud and posturing what is needed is agaponic technology the tools to overcome all forms of harmful violence and warfare to neutralize it by peaceful non destructive means thats on the technological front the second thing and perhaps more important is an ontological change in our natural makeup i have outlined this in my posts and the third thing is an understanding of what is true and what is false through the guidance of our conscience feelings of rightness confidence and peace comfort as opposed to guilt and vengeful anger and most importantly the objective statement of loving kindness it is through recognising the dualisms of good and evil and understanding them in all their substance and power that we can aspire to understand and appreciate the true good to deny the existence of evil or good is sometimes to be overtaken by the forces of darkness this is since that evil can only be resisted if it is understood to exist the teaching of non dualism sometimes found in some eastern religions denies the existence of evil and in a sense it is right there is nothing purely evil but it is also wrong i say wrong since without acknowledging the existence of evil one will never aspire to be good nor perhaps be able to resist his assimilation into it it is only by recognising human pride and forcefulness that we can work at overcoming it within ourselves never mind others the buck starts with me and you perhaps one of the greatest storys ever told i find the symbolism in this book akin to that in the never ending story by michael ende but even better do take care love flakey xxx',\n",

       " 'i remember well thanks to the wall to wall media coverage the horrific murder of six year old jonbenet ramsey back in december of she died on christmas evening or in the early morning hours of december th at the home of her wealthy parents john and patsy ramsey in boulder colorado the case quickly turned into a media circus rivaled only by the o j simpson trial and perhaps the lindbergh baby kidnapping back in the early s this case was huge and i largely ignored it at the time i didn t want to give the trash media the satisfaction of reading their sordid accounts of the crime and the family s background my interest in the case perked up recently not with the arrest and subsequent release of john mark karr but with the death of patsy ramsey in june i started out by perusing several well known websites dealing with the case and quickly became intrigued with the downright weirdness that occurred in that house on a winter s night so long ago and believe me this killing ranks as one of the weirdest events in american criminal history my investigations into the ramsey murder soon led me to lawrence schiller s book perfect murder perfect town often referred to as the bible of the jonbenet murder and subsequent investigation schiller s hefty tome clocks in at six hundred pages in the hardback edition the author dives right into the mess starting with the discovery of the enigmatic ransom note the subsequent finding of jonbenet s body in the wine cellar and the opening stages of the investigation schiller captures well the sense of confusion that gripped both the police and the ramsey household in those early hours and days of the investigation it soon becomes apparent that the boulder police department bungled the entire affair they allowed friends of the ramseys to wonder around the house before the discovery of the body and they failed to provide a sufficient number of police officers to seal the premises before and after john ramsey found his daughter s corpse even worse we learn from this book that the structure of the boulder police department contributed to the ineptness that would soon enshroud the inquiry detectives placed in charge of the case weren t adequately trained to investigate murders in fact most of them worked in other departments totally unrelated to homicide investigation moreover they refused assistance from other police departments schiller s book looks at far more angles of the case than mere murder investigation we do get detailed rundowns of the crime scene the evidence the autopsy and many of the suspects swirling around the case but it s what goes on outside the investigation that makes this book such a must read for jonbenet sleuths the author describes in minute some would probably say exhausting detail the political machinations that went on between the boulder police department the media the boulder district attorney s office and the ramsey family it s an ugly scene all around as various personalities in the case vie for media attention throw fits over the leaking of evidence and file lawsuits against one another numerous careers died painful deaths because of the ramsey debacle perfect murder perfect town also exposes the hopelessly liberal legal techniques used by boulder authorities to fight crime in a town with a low murder rate poorly trained cops and a district attorney s office unwilling to take cases in front of a judge unless they had a veritable mountain of evidence it s no wonder the ramsey case remains unsolved if you wanted to commit murder and get away with it you couldn t pick a better place than boulder colorado i had a few major problems with the book that i ll get to later but the good definitely outweighs the bad schiller spent a year living in boulder investigating the crime and talking to principal actors in the unfolding drama and it definitely shows perfect murder perfect town reads like an encyclopedia of this intriguing murder case the cast of characters is enormous yet schiller navigates his way through the names with ease he s also a master at capturing and then conveying to the reader the emotional impressions people involved in the case had at various moments whether during the discovery of jonbenet s body or the frustrations experienced by the cops as the investigation descends into anarchy arguably the best part of the book however comes when you finally close the cover for the last time and realize that schiller never takes a position on who killed jonbenet was it an intruder or was it the parents if you come into this with a neutral stance you will find yourself buffeted back and forth as evidence seems to point to an intruder on one page the parents on the next o k the bad stuff if i decided to write a research paper on the jonbenet ramsey murder or just wanted to use perfect murder perfect town as a reference guide in my own sleuthing i would soon find myself screaming in rage why the book has no index none it has a floor plan of the ramsey house and the resignation letters of detective steve thomas and lou smit an aside if i or someone i love is ever murdered i want lou smit on the case but no index good lord how could you ever go back and find anything in the book without an index someone fell down on the job big time with this grave omission another big problem involves the lack of photographs i don t expect autopsy pictures here but snapshots of the principal characters would go a long way in helping a reader visualize who s who still the book is an absolute must for anyone interested in this crime it s not a quick read and it s not comprehensive no one book will ever be in this weird case but it s good i m docking it a star for the abovementioned problems',\n",

       " 'there are many theories as to why the united states rose to economic dominance in the world to some this result was inevitable but that success was achieved in spite of some major setbacks gordon describes the history of the united states in economic terms and from many of the events we can see much about what has been done well and that which was done poorly from these events we can also find some guidance concerning how things should be done in the future there were three major economic crises in the first two hundred years the first was the aftermath of the revolution for independence since most of the colonial trade was with england and many of the wealthy were opposed to freedom from england there was a major economic downturn after the war ended many types of currency were in circulation and the new country was an economic basket case fortunately for the future of the country there was a person who knew how to solve the problem and had the stature to carry it out that man was alexander hamilton and his program of establishing and funding a national debt was a resounding success in the united states government was financially insolvent yet five years later it had the highest credit rating in europe hamilton also established a central bank which served as a financial anchor for the nation as long as it existed gordon gives hamilton his due credit for this noting some of the opposition by other founding fathers who couldn t fathom it and what it has meant for the country since then the second major crisis was much more long term namely the abolition of the central bank by andrew jackson his actions led to the deepest and lengthiest economic depression that the country has ever seen the early years of the s were a boom time all government debt had been retired and there was a revenue surplus his executive order in requiring land be paid for in gold and silver led to a banking collapse interest rates skyrocketed and in less than a year percent of the nation s factories were closed the bottom of this depression was not reached until six years after jackson s order as gordon points out the lack of a central bank was a problem that continued to fester until the federal reserve system was established in even then it was not up to the task and it was the depression of the s that led to the changes that molded it into the form we know today it can be argued that the greatest single mistake ever made by an american president was andrew jackson s destruction of the central bank the third major crisis was the great depression of the s what made it so much more devastating than the depression of the s were the different demographics of the country in a much larger percentage of the people worked in factories and fewer could rely on subsistence agriculture to survive it was also a time when there were political alternatives that seemed more effective fascism appeared to have solved many of the problems in germany and italy and the communist faade of success in the soviet union was attractive to many what makes this book outstanding is how gordon treats problems such as these in explaining the causes and why the solutions worked it is easy to see many of the reasons why the united states has grown to economic dominance such as an abundance of natural resources very low military spending for most of time the large influx of a labor force determined to succeed and a legal system that protected individual rights one other fundamental lesson that can be derived from the book is the value of targeted government spending and support for critical infrastructure the erie canal and the transcontinental railroad were both incredible achievements that cost a great deal but returned enormous economic advantages fully one third of the capital in new york was used to fund the erie canal yet it took less than ten years for this debt to be paid off government support was critical in steering those projects to success and we also have the modern example of the internet to many the rise of the economic power of the united states was inevitable as gordon points out that is probably but not necessarily the case in any case this is an epic history of the rise of american economic power',\n",

       " 'personal reflectionsthis book review pertains to the kindle edition this edition includes the fellowship of the ring the two towers and the return of the king in one combined volume technically there are six books two in each volume of course peter jackson followed each of the three books listed above for his film adaptation of this story this was my second time reading this story actually the word story doesn t really do justice to it it really deserves the title of epic it could be described as a modern day homeric quest adventure story i m not sure i could say that it surpasses the odyssey but nevertheless this work is a masterpiece of literature it is not simply the writing style that is superb it is also the fictional historical background of this work tolkien created a world from whole cloth this is why it is such genius while tolkien may have used themes from other works of literature he made this world from his imagination from scratch what more can i really say about it it is gritty real scary at times full of hope at other times the conclusion is exhilarating the characters become real to us the readers they leap off the page in stark reality from frodo sam and gollum to aragorn gimli and legolas these characters reveal themselves to us as the story progresses it is a delight to read about the insights of a particular character or the struggles they have the decisions that they face require real courage and of course they have real consequences in their struggles we see our own struggles except on a much smaller scale we are made to feel as if we ourselves would be brave enough to take the one ring and cast it into the fires of mount doom the frailty of the characters makes us reflect of our own humanness we too fail at times we too are faced with daunting decisions that are life altering just as the world they live in is threatened by sauron and saruman we too face our own threats the one that most deeply affects us is our own sin our hearts deceive us they make us believe that we are ok when really we are not frodo knew his own frailty yet he also was driven by a higher sense of purpose something transcendent this is where the christianity of tolkien really shines through god may not have a ring for us to destroy but if we follow in the footsteps of jesus we will have evil that needs driving out there will be enemies that need conquering things like envy or greed it is said that absolute power corrupts absolutely it is true tolkien drives this point home with the metaphor of the one ring the ring holds a great amount of power the story is driven by the ring it plays on our understanding of our own human nature the ring in the story must be kept at a distance and eventually destroyed it always corrupts the possessor ultimately it was not the determination of the hero s heart that accomplished the destruction of the ring but the providential role of gollum it was his greed that bit the finger off of frodo s hand it was providence that made his foot slip and caused him to fall to his doom his time had come there was a reason that gollum was spared until the very end i believe this providence reflects the providence of god conclusionmy conclusion is of course for you to read it if you have only seen the movies and liked them you really owe it to yourself to read these books or the one volume version at least listen to them via audio book you will find the richness of tolkien s writing to seriously enhance your appreciation of the movies the extended edition of the movie follows right along with every scene in the books i would also recommend to you the background material in the appendix to the book this will help to fill in even further the historical background to the story tolkien s preparation for this book really shines through here it is the story behind the story before he wrote the lord of the rings tolkien had to create this fantasy world from scratch the amount of detail and realistic history belies the genius of tolkien you want to read good fantasy literature this one is the standard by which others are judged i don t imagine that it will be surpassed any time soon',\n",
       " 'i read reading lolita in tehran and felt its power and important political and social message i told other people about it and passed it on to friends male and female i think the females enjoyed it more perhaps because it is a book about a group of women in iran i am not sure if men will have more trouble understanding some of the oppression these women went through not only did they have to worry about the books they were reading but they faced constant persecution from police regarding their dress the rules about head covering and make up the women in the book have to deal with terrible stress over the most minor issues and they live in constant fear i found it tragic inspiring and extremely interesting reading lolita in tehran makes you appreciate the fact that in a free nation one may read whatever book one chooses and wear whatever one chooses without fear of punishment i think it is difficult for those of us who are fortunate enough to live in countries which have freedom of speech and expression to understand the kind of danger many people face in countries which do not have those freedoms it is very surreal to imagine that you could be put into jail for reading or talking about certain books or even by looking at certain pictures in books it is important to know that there are countries in this world where women especially are oppressed marginalized and kept as second class citizens it is a terrible outrage and the author who had to flee iran expresses these emotions with dignity and grace she is truly a great writer and i hope she writes more books in the future this would be a great book for a book club to read i hope more people become aware of the struggle of iranian women',\n",

       " 'the mauritius command the fourth novel in the series by richard patrick russ writing under the nom de plume of patrick o brian is a distinct improvement over one of its predecessors post captain russ o brian seems to have abandoned his annoying experiments in writing techniques and has settled down to more or less a simple straight forward narrative style which is imminently more readable as in earlier volumes this book does not continue precisely where its predecessor left off however in this case the missing events are easily understood and reconstructed in the reader s consciousness we do find that jack aubrey s marriage to sophie is not precisely fulfilling for him not surprisingly we find that aubrey s first love remains the sea and that he is not exactly the model of a perfect spouse of course if one reads the author s real life biography russ o brian was far from a perfect husband and one wonders whether he has somewhat patterned aubrey after himself but let us not read too much into that soon aubrey is called to sea again and the maritime action resumes and continues throughout the remainder of the book unlike post captain this volume does not ramble for pages and pages about aubrey s floundering on shore life thank goodness if one has a creative imagination he could actually begin with the mauritius command but the reader will certainly have a more complete appreciation of the characters if he has begun with the first volume master and commander and has approached each successive volume in order post captain then hms surprise and only then the mauritius command perhaps we should consider each novel as an additional chapter in one extraordinarily lengthy book this is not necessarily a criticism just a caution to a reader who might be tempted to sample russ o brian s work by starting in the middle of the series the author does engage in some character development and by this fourth book the person of dr stephen maturin has become more complex that we suspected at first not only is he an unusually gifted physician but it seems as though he has shadowy political connections and is as instrumental as a secret agent as he is as a doctor while this certainly provides a most interesting twist to the character of the good doctor i sense that russ o brian is learning about his creation at the same time we are i do not feel that he prepared us for this sort of complication in maturin s nature while i enjoy the increased complexity in the doctor i am not at all sure that the author intended this from the beginning but suspect that he may be developing his characters by whim rather than by intent the mauritius command keeps the reader entertained throughout its length but after having now read four books in the series i feel that russ o brian is a somewhat superficial writer who realizes that he should paint some complexity into his characters to keep them from becoming mere stereotypes but does not quite understand how to do this as a writer he is certainly superior to the authors of what we used to call dime novel bodice rippers but he is far from displaying the skill of a c s forrester or a herman melville i would suggest that the aubrey maturin series of maritime adventure books is decent entertainment but that the novels are not especially memorable i also find myself wondering whether the surface action that is the plot or superficial story line may not become repetitious and boring before one reaches the end of the multi book series i m actually hoping that russ o brian will mature more fully as an author as he accrues more experience in writing the future volumes we shall see how he handles the fifth book desolation island next',\n",
